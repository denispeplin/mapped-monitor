== Mapped monitor

Attempt to create application which will monitor services
and display results on the map

== Application state

Creating and displaying locations on map now works

And it support icons with three colors!

Basic ajax also added.

So, with ajax timer, and some external service checker,
basic mapped monitoring application can work
